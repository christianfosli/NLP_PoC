(3) When a vessel is substantially altered or modified, the vessel shall comply with the requirements for a new vessel. 0 Amended by Regulation of 4 May 2015 No.. 445 (in force on 6 May 2015). Section 8. Fire safety (1) Vessels constructed after 1 January 1992 shall have structural fire protection in accordance with chapter C14 of Nordic Boat Standard (1990), unless otherwise provided by the individual provisions of this chapter. (2) Vessels constructed before 1 January 1992 shall have structural fire protection in accordance with the rules applicable at the time of construction of the vessel. (3) Irrespective of the year of construction of the vessel, gasfired installations shall satisfy the requirements of Regulations of 20 October 1983 No. 1580 on safety precautions for gasfired installations, etc. operating on propane or other liquefied hydrocarbon gases used on board vessels. Section 9. Oil-fired stoves (1) Stoves with electric power supply shall have an oil supply which shuts off automatically if: a) the stove is over-heated (maximum 400°C in smoke gas); b) the flame goes out; c) a failure occurs in the supply of air or power. (2) Stoves without electric power supply shall have an oil supply which shuts off automatically if a) the stove is over-heated (maximum 400°C in smoke gas); b) the flame goes out. (3) Drip regulation stoves (regulation valve with observation hole) need not have automatic shutoff of the oil supply if the flame will go out due to the oil consumption being limited by an oil regulation valve. The installation instructions shall indicate the maximum permitted difference in height between the oil tank and the regulation valve. An oil pressure reduction valve shall be fitted if satisfactory regulation of the oil supply cannot be achieved through pressure variations. The overflow system shall be capable of receiving the full volume of the tank. (4) The resetting of the safety function shall be manual. (5) The installation instructions shall be kept on board. The instructions for use shall be posted near the stove. (6) Stoves with accessories shall be installed in accordance with the installation instructions from the manufacturer. (7) Stoves shall have smoke outlet to uptake. Section 10. Installation, etc. of oilfired stove (1) Stoves shall be securely fixed to the floor or to a fixed bench, if possible near the centre line of the vessel. (2) Stoves without automatic shutoff of oil supply in the event of the flame going out, shall be provided with a separate oil tank of maximum 40 litres. The oil tank shall not be filled automatically, and shall be placed on the height indicated in the installation instructions. (3) The oil tank shall have a water separator and a plug for draining off possible collection of water and shall be placed outside the space where the stove is installed. (4) The oil pipe to the regulator shall have a filter for the separation of mud and water. The filter shall not be fitted above the stove. (5) Pipes made of copper or equivalent material shall be used between the tank and the stove. The pipes shall be fixed and placed so as to prevent the formation of air pockets. (6) Stoves shall have overflow openings with drain pipes and collection tank. Both the stove and the float valve, if used, shall be connected to the collection tank. (7) Smoke uptake pipes shall have a diameter which is not less than the smoke outlet of the stove, and the piping shall be made as straight as possible. (8) Drainage of condensed water mud, cleaning of filters, inspection of burners and other components shall be carried out in the time intervals stipulated in the operating instructions. (9) Spaces with a stove shall be well ventilated. (10) On vessels of 8 to 15 metres in overall length the stove shall be inspected by an approved company within six months of being installed.

(4) Vessels of less than 10.67 metres in overall length constructed after 1 January 1992 may as an alternative be equipped with a fire-extinguishing system in accordance with guidelines laid down in chapter C14 of Nordic Boat Standard (1990). (5) CO2 containers and other containers for extinguishing gas which could may be hazardous in the event of a leak, with appurtenant release device, shall be placed in a separate space locker outside the machinery space. Gastight bulkheads shall be provided to adjacent spaces and entrance from open deck. An alarm signal shall be activated automatically when the CO2 space locker is opened. It should be ensured that no persons are present in the machinery space before the CO2 gas is released. The space locker for release of CO2 shall have ventilation to the open air. Section 16. Fire detection and alarm system (1) Vessels of 10.67 to 15 metres in overall length, irrespective of year of construction, shall have fire detection system and fire alarm system for machinery spaces and smoke alarm system for the cabins in accordance with Appendix 5. (2) Vessels of less than 10.67 meters in overall length shall be fitted with at least one smoke detector and one heat detector in machinery spaces, at least one smoke detector in recreational spaces, and at least one smoke detector in the wheelhouse. Section 17. Fire extinguishers (1) All vessels, irrespective of year of construction, shall have at least two approved fire extinguishers of at least 6 kg. At least one approved fire extinguisher shall be placed at a suitable place outside the machinery space and at least one approved fire extinguisher shall be placed in the accommodation spaces. For vessels without wheelhouse or accommodation spaces one fire extinguisher is sufficient. (1) Fire extinguishers with pressurised extinguishing medium shall not be placed in accommodation spaces. Fire extinguishers which may be exposed to frost shall be of a frost-proof type. (3) At least one spare charge shall be provided for each extinguisher. If the extinguisher is of a type that cannot be charged on board, the number of extinguishers shall be increased by 50 per cent. (4) Fire extinguishers shall be inspected annually in accordance with NS3910. The date of the inspection shall be marked on the extinguisher. 0 Amended by Regulation of 4 May 2015 No.. 445 (in force on 6 May 2015). Section 18. Ventilation systems The vessel's machinery space shall have at least two ventilators capable of being closed from deck. Cabins shall have at least two ventilators with a diameter of at least 8 cm. Section 19. Materials, etc. Materials, varnishes, paints, etc. produced on a nitrocellulose basis or any other basis which will readily ignite are not permitted to be used anywhere on board. Section 20. Storage of oil fuel and other flammable liquids (1) Oil fuel shall be stored in tanks of steel or equivalent material. (2) Outlets from oil fuel tanks shall be fitted with a closing valve or cock on the tank itself, which is capable of being closed from the deck. Test cocks and cocks for oil gauge glass shall be of a self-closing type. The tank shall be fitted with drip trays. In decked vessels with machinery space, filling pipes and airing pipes shall be carried through the deck and into open air. (3) If extra fuel or other flammable liquids cannot be placed on open deck, they shall be stored in suitable containers in a well-ventilated room locker with a door communicating only with open deck and without electrical or other sources of ignition. Section 21. Materials in pipelines, etc. (1) Seawater pipes, bilge pipes, pipes conveying oil and other pipelines required for the safety of the ship shall be made of non-combustible material. Short, flexible pipe connections made of a material which is not easily rendered ineffective by heat, may be accepted on: a) seawater pipes; b) short, flexible pipe connections on pipes conveying oil, when necessitated by vibrations. (2) Where failure of the material due to fire may lead to flooding, scuppers, sanitary discharges or other outlets which are close to the waterline shall be made of oil-resistant and reinforced materials which are not easily damaged by heat.
