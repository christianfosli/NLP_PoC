(1) Decked vessels of more than 6 metres in overall length shall have a type-approved liferaft with capacity for the total number of persons on board . (2) Vessels with a maximum of three persons on board may as an alternative to a type-approved liferaft use a liferaft intended for at least four persons and manufactured in accordance with ISO 9650-1 (Group A), provided that the raft is placed maximum three metres above the waterline in the least favourable loading condition . The buoyancy of the raft shall be in accordance with the requirements of the LSA Code for buoyancy of float-free lifeboats . (3) Vessels with a liferaft for recreational craft for four people shall replace these with rafts pursuant to the first or second paragraph by: a) 1 July 2015 for vessels operating in trade area In-shore fishing; b) 1 July 2016 for vessels operating in trade area Fjord fishing . (4) Inflatable liferafts shall be inspected by an approved service station for inflatable liferafts at least every 24 months, in line with the manufacturer's recommendations and approval criteria . (5) Liferafts shall be ready for use and so placed as to permit them to float free from their stowage, inflate and break free from the vessel in the event of its sinking . Lashings, if used, shall have a hydrostatic release system . (6) Posters or placards with information about the location, treatment and use of the rafts shall be posted on board . (7) Auxiliary vessels need not have a liferaft if the crew is only on board during fishing activities and are otherwise on board the main vessel . Section 39 . Placement of life-saving appliances . (1) The life-saving appliances shall as far as possible be equally distributed on each side of the vessel, and be placed so that there is sufficient space for preparation, operation and embarkation . (2) The life-saving appliances shall be placed so that they do not protrude from the vessel's sides, at a safe distance from the waterline and propellers, and so that they as far as practicable can be launched with vertical shipside . (3) It shall be possible for one person to launch the life-saving appliances by himself . Section 40 . Alarm equipment . Vessels shall have suitable means for alerting everyone on board about meeting at the life-saving appliances and about when the vessel should be abandoned . Section 41 . Boarding of life-saving appliances . Vessels on which the height from the water plane to where the life-saving appliances are to be boarded is more than two metres in the smallest draught in ballast, shall have a ladder or other approved equipment providing access to the life-saving appliances when they are in the water . Section 42 . Precautions for keeping life-saving appliances and other rescue equipment ready for use . All life-saving appliances and other rescue equipment shall be in good condition and ready for immediate use, also in unfavourable conditions of list or trim . Section 43 . Lifebuoys .

(2) At least half of the lifebuoys shall have approved buoy lights and all the lifebuoys shall: a) be marked with the vessel ’ s name and port of registry; and b) be placed conspicuously and readily available, so that they can be released quickly and easily . (3) Vessels of 10.67 to 15 metres in overall length shall have at least one lifebuoy on each side fitted with a buoyant lifeline of at least 30 metres . On vessels of less than 10.67 metres in overall length, one such buoy is sufficient . (4) On vessels required to have two or more lifebuoys, at least one buoy shall be placed at the stern and one near the place where work with fishing gear occurs . Section 44 . Distress signal equipment and pyrotechnical equipment . (1) Vessels shall be equipped with means for making effective distress signals by day and by night . Vessels shall have at least two smoke signals . In addition, vessels shall have the following equipment: a) three rocket parachute flares and three red hand flares in trade area Fjord fishing; b) three rocket parachute flares and three red hand flares in trade area In-shore fishing; c) six rocket parachute flares and four red hand flares in trade area Bank fishing I; d) six rocket parachute flares and four red hand flares in trade area Bank fishing II . (2) Distress signal equipment shall be type-approved, clearly marked and kept in a suitable casing in an easily accessible place . Distress signal equipment shall be replaced at the latest within the indicated use-by date or three years from date of manufacture if use-by date is not indicated . Section 45 .
