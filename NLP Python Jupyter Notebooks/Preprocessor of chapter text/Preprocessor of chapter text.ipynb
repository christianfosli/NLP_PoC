(6) Stoves shall have overflow openings with drain pipes and collection tank . Both the stove and the float valve, if used, shall be connected to the collection tank . (7) Smoke uptake pipes shall have a diameter which is not less than the smoke outlet of the stove, and the piping shall be made as straight as possible . (8) Drainage of condensed water/mud, cleaning of filters, inspection of burners and other components shall be carried out in the time intervals stipulated in the operating instructions . (9) Spaces with a stove shall be well ventilated . (10) On vessels of 8 to 15 metres in overall length the stove shall be inspected by an approved company within six months of being installed . Section 11 . Insulation of fireplaces, etc . (1) Bulkheads shall be insulated with non-combustible material in accordance with Appendix 4 . (2) Below stoves, wooden floor or combustible floor covering shall be protected by steel or aluminium sheets covering the whole floor area under the fireplace and in front of the stove at least 15 centimetre from the fire door . Where the stove is placed on a bench or similar, the bench shall be protected by non-combustible material . Section 12 . Smoke uptake and exhaust pipes . (1) Smoke uptakes and exhaust pipes shall consist of at least 3 millimetre thick steel plates and shall be securely fixed . Smoke uptakes shall be carried at least 1.3 metre above deck . (2) Saucer formed rockwool sheets of at least 6 centimetre thickness shall be provided between smoke uptake and combustible material . Insulation in the form of non-combustible material shall be provided between metal cover plates and combustible material . Alternatively, a pipe with a diameter at least 6 centimetre larger than the smoke uptake pipe may be fitted outside this pipe, in order to provide vertical air circulation between the pipes . Insulation by saucer formed rockwool or mineral wool twine of at least 3 centimetre thickness shall be provided between the outer pipe and combustible material . The pipe shall be carried to at least 1 metre above the deck, and the outlet shall be protected with a collar . (3) When smoke uptake is carried along a bulkhead, the bulkhead shall be insulated with non-combustible material . Smoke uptakes shall not be placed closer than 10 centimetre to insulated bulkheads . Where the smoke uptake (pipe) is insulated with saucer formed rockwool or mineral wool twine of at least 2 centimetre thickness, the distance to the insulated bulkhead may be reduced to 5 centimetre . (4) Any exhaust manifold which is not watercooled, and parts of exhaust pipes which may cause ignition, shall be insulated so that oil cannot penetrate . Where gases are watercooled, other arrangements may be accepted . Exhaust pipes shall not be closer than 2 centimetre to combustible material . (5) Oil pipes shall be placed as far as possible away from exhaust pipes and hot engine parts . Section 13 . Insulation with non-combustible material .
