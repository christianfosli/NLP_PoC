The installation instructions shall indicate the maximum permitted difference in height between the oil tank and the regulation valve. An oil pressure reduction valve shall be fitted if satisfactory regulation of the oil supply cannot be achieved through pressure variations. The overflow system shall be capable of receiving the full volume of the tank.\n\n(4) The resetting of the safety function shall be manual.\n\n(5) The installation instructions shall be kept on board. The instructions for use shall be posted near the stove.\n\n(6) Stoves with accessories shall be installed in accordance with the installation instructions from the manufacturer.\n\n(7) Stoves shall have smoke outlet to uptake.\n\n\n\nSection 10. Installation, etc. of oilfired stove\n\n(1) Stoves shall be securely fixed to the floor or to a fixed bench, if possible near the centre line of the vessel.\n\n(2) Stoves without automatic shutoff of oil supply in the event of the flame going out, shall be provided with a separate oil tank of maximum 40 litres. The oil tank shall not be filled automatically, and shall be placed on the height indicated in the installation instructions.\n\n(3) The oil tank shall have a water separator and a plug for draining off possible collection of water and shall be placed outside the space where the stove is installed.\n\n(4) The oil pipe to the regulator shall have a filter for the separation of mud and water. The filter shall not be fitted above the stove.\n\n(5) Pipes made of copper or equivalent material shall be used between the tank and the stove. The pipes shall be fixed and placed so as to prevent the formation of air pockets.\n\n(6) Stoves shall have overflow openings with drain pipes and collection tank. Both the stove and the float valve, if used, shall be connected to the collection tank.\n\n(7) Smoke uptake pipes shall have a diameter which is not less than the smoke outlet of the stove, and the piping shall be made as straight as possible.\n\n(8) Drainage of condensed water/mud, cleaning of filters, inspection of burners and other components shall be carried out in the time intervals stipulated in the operating instructions.\n\n(9) Spaces with a stove shall be well ventilated.\n\n(10) On vessels of 8 to 15 metres in overall length the stove shall be inspected by an approved company within six months of being installed.\n\n\n\nSection 11. Insulation of fireplaces, etc.\n\n(1) Bulkheads shall be insulated with non-combustible material in accordance with Appendix 4.\n\n(2) Below stoves, wooden floor or combustible floor covering shall be protected by steel or aluminium sheets covering the whole floor area under the fireplace and in front of the stove at least 15 cm from the fire door. Where the stove is placed on a bench or similar, the bench shall be protected by non-combustible material.\n\n\n\nSection 12. Smoke uptake and exhaust pipes\n\n(1) Smoke uptakes and exhaust pipes shall consist of at least 3 mm thick steel plates and shall be securely fixed. Smoke uptakes shall be carried at least 1.3 m above deck.\n\n(2) Saucer formed rockwool sheets of at least 6 cm thickness shall be provided between smoke uptake and combustible material. Insulation in the form of non-combustible material shall be provided between metal cover plates and combustible material. Alternatively, a pipe with a diameter at least 6 cm larger than the smoke uptake pipe may be fitted outside this pipe, in order to provide vertical air circulation between the pipes. Insulation by saucer formed rockwool or mineral wool twine of at least 3 cm thickness shall be provided between the outer pipe and combustible material. The pipe shall be carried to at least 1 m above the deck, and the outlet shall be protected with a collar.\n\n(3) When smoke uptake is carried along a bulkhead, the bulkhead shall be insulated with non-combustible material. Smoke uptakes shall not be placed closer than 10 cm to insulated bulkheads. Where the smoke uptake (pipe) is insulated with saucer formed rockwool or mineral wool twine of at least 2 cm thickness, the distance to the insulated bulkhead may be reduced to 5 cm.\n\n(4) Any exhaust manifold which is not watercooled, and parts of exhaust pipes which may cause ignition, shall be insulated so that oil cannot penetrate. Where gases are watercooled, other arrangements may be accepted. Exhaust pipes shall not be closer than 2 cm to combustible material.\n\n(5) Oil pipes shall be placed as far as possible away from exhaust pipes and hot engine parts.\n\n\n\nSection 13. Insulation with non-combustible material\n\nNon-combustible material means a material which, when tested and evaluated in accordance with MSC.61(67) (the FTP Code), satisfies the requirements for qualifying materials as non-combustible. The insulation shall, if necessary in order to preserve the fire-insulating effect, be mounted with a sheet of galvanized steel or aluminium.\n\n\n\nSection 14. Insulation of machinery spaces in wooden vessels\n\n(1) Machinery spaces in wooden vessels shall have floors of steel or aluminium plates. Machinery spaces shall be insulated with non-combustible material or have an approved fire-extinguishing system.\n\n(2) In machinery spaces without inside planking, wooden casings, beams and surfaces under deck as well as bulkheads forwards and aft in the machinery space shall be insulated with non-combustible material.\n\n(3) In machinery spaces with inside planking, all woodwork shall be insulated with non-combustible material down to the lower edge of the floor. No insulation is required behind fuel oil tanks if the other insulation is fitted tightly around the tank.\n\n(4) In vessels where the engine is not placed in a separate compartment, all combustible material which is exposed to heat from exhaust manifolds, exhaust pipes, etc. shall be insulated with non-combustible material. When an engine cover is used, this shall be insulated on the inside and be mounted with a galvanized steel or aluminium sheet.\n\n\n\nSection 15.
