{"text": "2.  Guidelines for installation "}
{"text": "2.2.1.  The engine-room shall be fitted with 1 smoke detector and 1 heat detector. Public spaces and cabins "}
{"text": "shall each be fitted with 1 smoke detector. 1 alarm instrument shall be installed in the wheelhouse and "}
{"text": "1 in the accommodation, the size of the vessel taken into consideration. "}
{"text": "2.2.3.   "}
{"text": "2.2.4.  Detectors and alarm instruments shall be installed on watertight coupling boxes. "}
{"text": "Annex 1 to Part II. Guidelines for the Selection and Location of Detectors in "}
{"text": "Machinery Spaces "}
{"text": "1. In order to achieve optimal monitoring of machinery spaces, a complete detector installation should consist "}
{"text": "of a combination of: "}
{"text": "- thermal detectors; "}
{"text": "- smoke/ion detectors; "}
{"text": "- flame detectors. "}
{"text": "2. Figure 1 (omitted) shows a cross section of typical machinery spaces with the locations of the various types "}
{"text": "of detectors sketched in. In conjunction with this diagram, general advice is given below on the use and "}
{"text": "location of detectors. "}
{"text": "Thermal detectors "}
{"text": "This type of detector is most suitable for small spaces having little or no ventilation, and where it is possible "}
{"text": "to install the detector closely above the object to be monitored. "}
{"text": "Smoke/ion detectors "}
{"text": "These detectors have a more general field of application and may be used practically anywhere in machinery "}
{"text": "spaces with comparatively high sensitivity. However, the use of smoke/ion detectors should be avoided in areas "}
{"text": "having a particularly high rate of ventilation and also in areas where free exhaust will occur from time to time. "}
{"text": "Flame detectors "}
{"text": "The flame detector is the type that reacts the most rapidly to a fire where there are flames, and it is also "}
{"text": "unaffected by ventilation conditions. It should therefore be used in areas of particularly high fire hazard (top of "}
{"text": "main engine, auxiliary engines/generators, boilers etc.) and in areas where circumstances make it difficult to "}
{"text": "use the other two types of detectors mentioned above. "}
{"text": "3. Location of smoke/ion detectors "}
{"text": "In order to ensure the best possible siting, the final location of these smoke detectors should be based on "}
{"text": "smoke tests under normal operating conditions. It is therefore recommended that these detectors should first be "}
{"text": "installed with «loose» loop cables, so that they may subsequently be moved within a reasonable area, "}
{"text": "depending on the smoke test results. "}
{"text": "4. It is recommended that the detector installation should be based on universal loops with universal sockets, so "}
{"text": "that one detector type may be replaced by another at a later stage, if experience should call for it. "}
{"text": "Annex 2 to Part II. Guidelines for approval of Fire Detection and Alarm "}
{"text": "Equipment when installed "}
{"text": "Before a fire detection and alarm installation may be approved, the completed installation shall be subjected "}
{"text": "to: "}
{"text": "a) Function tests "}
{"text": "b) Sensitivity tests "}
{"text": "Final approval will depend on favourable results of these tests. "}
{"text": "1.  Function tests "}
{"text": "1.1. Function tests of central alarm panels, power supply, and all warning/alarm instruments. "}
{"text": "These tests shall comprise all control, fault indicating and alarm functions. Alarm and loop malfunctions "}
{"text": "shall be tested by simulation applied at the loop infeeds to the central alarm panel. Function testing of the "}
{"text": "power supply shall include automatic switching from main to emergency power supply and maximum load "}
{"text": "tests of both power supplies, which shall last at least 30 minutes in the case of the main supply and 5 "}
{"text": "minutes for the emergency supply. "}
{"text": "Functions such as closing of doors, stopping of fans, etc. shall be checked at the respective locations. "}
{"text": "1.2. Function tests of detector loops. "}
{"text": "These tests shall comprise testing of all detectors in all loops. Thermal detectors which cannot be reset "}
{"text": "(fuse-link detectors and the like) may be tested by simulation at the connections of the detectors. Other "}
{"text": "thermal detectors shall be tested with hot air or similar. Smoke and flame detectors shall be tested as "}
{"text": "prescribed by the manufacturer. "}
{"text": "At least two of the loops shall be checked to ensure that detectability is unimpaired even in the event of "}
{"text": "breakage of the loop circuit, unless this itself automatically activates the alarm. "}
{"text": "2.  Sensitivity tests "}
{"text": "2.1. Sensitivity tests shall be carried out in accordance with a standard test fire, defined as follows:  "}
{"text": "An open, rectangular steel vessel measuring 300 × 300 × 150 mm filled with 1 litre of diesel oil and 0.25 "}
{"text": "kg of cotton waste evenly distributed in the vessel. During the tests, the temperature of the diesel oil shall "}
{"text": "be at least 50°C and not more than 60°C at the time of ignition. "}
{"text": "2.2. Sensitivity tests of the detection system in machinery spaces shall be carried out by placing test fires in "}
{"text": "various relevant positions in the machinery spaces, the minimum sensitivity requirement being that the "}
{"text": "system is activated within 3 minutes, irrespective of the position of the test fire. "}
{"text": "These tests shall be carried out in at least five different positions, including areas at the top of the main "}
{"text": "engine(s), the auxiliary engines/generators and oil-fired boilers. "}

{"text": "Appendix 6. Procedures for execution of inclining tests and lightweight "}
{"text": "surveys for Norwegian ships "}
{"text": "Determination of lightship displacement and centres of gravity "}
{"text": "1. Introduction "}
{"text": "According to Norwegian regulations on the construction of Norwegian passenger ships, cargo ships and "}
{"text": "barges, as well as for fishing vessels, the following main principles for the determination and approval of "}
{"text": "lightship displacement and centres of gravity apply: "}
{"text": "- The execution shall be in accordance with procedures laid down by the Norwegian Maritime Authority, "}
{"text": "and the results shall be entered in the prescribed form. "}
{"text": "- The calculations of the lightship data shall be approved by the Norwegian Maritime Authority before the "}
{"text": "ship is put into service. "}
{"text": "- If the design of the ship is such that there is a reason to assume that an inclining test made according to "}
{"text": "normal procedures will not provide reliable lightship data, the Norwegian Maritime Authority shall be "}
{"text": "contacted. "}
{"text": "The purpose of the following guidelines is to ensure the accuracy of the determined lightship displacement "}
{"text": "and centres of gravity, and constitutes the procedures referred to above. This document is based on Chapter 7 of "}
{"text": "IMO Res. A.749(18), \"Code on Intact Stability for All Types of Ships Covered by IMO Instruments\". Although "}
{"text": "the mentioned IMO Resolution was primarily written for larger ships, these procedures are also adaptable to "}
{"text": "ships of less than 24 m in length, when the necessary precautions are taken in order to ensure the accuracy of "}
{"text": "the test. The Code also contains an annex with more detailed practical guidance. Although not considered an "}
{"text": "integral part of these guidelines, the Norwegian Maritime Authority recommends that the contents of that annex "}
{"text": "are studied as additional guidance in connection with the planning of inclining tests and lightweight surveys. "}
{"text": "While compliance with the procedures outlined herein will facilitate an expeditious and accurate lightweight "}
{"text": "survey and inclining test, it is recognised that alternative procedures or arrangements may be equally efficient, "}
{"text": "and in some cases necessary. However, to avoid delays, all significant deviations from these guidelines must be "}
{"text": "submitted to the Norwegian Maritime Authority for consideration in reasonable time prior to the execution. "}
{"text": "Such submissions must be accompanied by proposals for measures to be taken in order to achieve an equivalent "}
{"text": "level of accuracy. "}
{"text": "For cargo ships, except offshore vessels, of 500 gross tonnage and upwards which are registered in the "}
{"text": "Norwegian International Ship Register (NIS), the ship's classification society is permanently appointed to act "}
{"text": "on behalf of the Norwegian Maritime Authority. For these ships, deviations from these guidelines shall be "}
{"text": "forwarded to the classification society for consideration. The classification societies may require documentation "}
{"text": "in accordance with their own procedures. "}
{"text": "As an alternative to these guidelines, Chapter 7 and Annex 1 in IMO Res. A.749(18) may be used if followed "}
{"text": "in their entirety. "}
{"text": "2. Definitions "}
{"text": "The Administration: the Norwegian Maritime Authority (NMA). "}
{"text": "Approved: Approved by the Norwegian Maritime Authority or whoever is authorised by the NMA.1 "}
{"text": "Inclining test: Determining the ship's vertical centre of gravity (VCG) in a given condition, normally by "}
{"text": "moving a series of known weights in the transverse direction, and then measuring the resulting change in the "}
{"text": "equilibrium heel angle of the ship. Lightship condition: A ship complete in all respects, but without "}
{"text": "consumables, stores, cargo, crew and effects, and without any liquids on board except that machinery and "}
{"text": "piping fluids, such as lubricant and hydraulics, are at their normal operating levels. "}
{"text": "Lightweight survey: Recording the ship's floating condition and the mass, longitudinal, transverse and vertical "}
{"text": "location of each item which should be added, deducted or relocated on the ship in its given condition so that the "}
{"text": "lightship displacement and centre of gravity can be determined from the ship's given condition. Determination "}
{"text": "of the transverse centre of gravity (TCG) may also be required for ships which are asymmetrical about the "}
{"text": "centreline or whose internal arrangement or outfitting is such that the ship may develop an inherent list from "}
{"text": "off-centre weight. "}
{"text": "Surveyor: Surveyor from the Norwegian Maritime Authority or another person appointed by and acting on "}

{"text": "Register (NIS), the ship's classification society is permanently appointed to act on behalf of the Norwegian Maritime Authority. "}
{"text": "3. Responsibilities "}
{"text": "According to Norwegian regulations, the responsibility for initiating lightweight surveys and inclining tests "}
{"text": "rests with the yard for ships being constructed or modified in Norway, and with the company if the ship is "}
{"text": "abroad. "}
{"text": "A qualified person shall be in charge of making preparations, conducting the lightweight survey and inclining "}
{"text": "test, recording the data and calculating the results. This person may be a representative of the yard or the "}
{"text": "company or a naval architect acting on their behalf. The responsibilities of this person are: "}
{"text": "Ascertaining that all necessary preparations have been made prior to the arrival of the attending surveyor. "}
{"text": "Administrate and coordinate the execution of the lightweight survey and inclining test. Collect complete results "}
{"text": "from all measurements as soon as these are available. "}
{"text": "Prepare results as expediently as possible in order to expose deficiencies and inaccuracies at an early stage. "}
{"text": "Submit the final lightweight survey or inclining test report to the surveyor for approval in reasonable time "}
{"text": "before the planned departure of the ship. "}
{"text": "The surveyor shall: "}
{"text": "- Attend the survey and note all information relevant for the approval of the final report. "}
{"text": "- Approve the report, if the conduct and the results are acceptable. "}
{"text": "- The surveyor reserves the right to present the report to the relevant vessel section at the NMA for further "}
{"text": "evaluation if in doubt. "}
{"text": "- Submit to the relevant vessel section at the NMA a copy of the approved report together with a copy of the "}
{"text": "letter of approval. "}
{"text": "In the case of a surveyor appointed on behalf of the NMA (excluding cargo ships of 500 gross tonnage and "}
{"text": "upwards registered in the Norwegian International Ship Register (NIS)), the surveyor shall: "}
{"text": "- Verify that the contents of the report coincides with his own notes and that these procedures were adhered "}
{"text": "to. "}
{"text": "- Submit the report in triplicate to the NMA for approval. "}
{"text": "4. Preparations for the lightweight survey "}
{"text": "4.1 Request for survey A surveyor shall be present to witness lightweight surveys and inclining tests, and the results shall be "}
{"text": "submitted to the attending surveyor for approval. "}
{"text": "A request for survey should be sent to the Administration in writing in due time before execution. For ships "}
{"text": "registered in the Norwegian Ordinary Ship Register (NOR), the request shall be forwarded by the yard to the "}
{"text": "local NMA station in the case of ships being constructed in Norway and by the company to the NMA head "}
{"text": "office for ships being constructed abroad. "}
{"text": "For cargo ships of 500 gross tonnage and upwards, which are registered in the Norwegian International Ship "}
{"text": "Register (NIS), the request shall be forwarded to the classification society in accordance with the procedures "}
{"text": "laid down by the society. "}
{"text": "Information to be included in the request "}
{"text": "The written request shall contain the following information: "}
{"text": "- identification of the ship by name, call sign and/or shipyard hull number; "}
{"text": "- date, time, and location of the survey; "}
{"text": "inclining weight data, if an inclining test is to be performed: "}
{"text": "- type of weights; "}
{"text": "- amount (number of units and weight of each); "}
{"text": "- certification of mass; "}
{"text": "- method of handling (i.e. sliding rail or crane); "}
{"text": "- mass and location of righting and/or trimming weights; "}
{"text": "- anticipated maximum angle of heel to each side; "}
{"text": "- approximate location and length of pendulums; "}
{"text": "- details on alternative solutions, if a substitution of a pendulum with an inclinometer or other device is "}
{"text": "desired; "}
{"text": "- anticipated trim; "}
{"text": "- anticipated condition of tanks; "}
{"text": "- estimated weights to add, deduct or relocate on the ship in order to place the ship in its true lightship "}
{"text": "condition; "}
{"text": "- description of computer software to be used to aid in calculations during the survey; "}
{"text": "- name and phone number of the person responsible for conducting the survey. "}
{"text": "4.2 General condition of the ship "}
{"text": "The ship should be as complete as possible at the time of the lightweight survey, but some flexibility will be "}
{"text": "acceptable in order to minimize the disruption in the ship's delivery date or its operational commitments. The "}
{"text": "amount and type of work left to be completed (weights to be added) will nevertheless affect the accuracy of the "}
{"text": "lightship characteristics, so good judgement should be used. If the weight or centre of gravity of an item to be "}
{"text": "added cannot be determined with confidence, the uncertainties will be reduced if the item is taken on board "}
{"text": "prior to the survey. "}
{"text": "Temporary material, toolboxes, staging, sand, debris, etc., on board should be reduced to an absolute "}
{"text": "minimum before the lightweight survey. "}
{"text": "All bilge water must be removed. "}
{"text": "System piping and system tanks should be filled to their normal operating levels. "}
{"text": "All spaces and tanks shall be available for inspection. Manholes leading to void spaces and tanks assumed "}
{"text": "empty shall be opened. Such spaces and tanks must be ventilated and gas-free to ensure that inspection can take "}
{"text": "place without danger. An approved explosion-proof testing device to check for sufficient oxygen and absence "}
{"text": "of lethal gases shall be available for the inspection. Decks should be free of water. Water trapped on deck during an inclining test may shift and pocket in a "}
{"text": "fashion similar to free surface effects in a tank. Any rain, snow or ice accumulated on the ship should be "}
{"text": "removed prior to the test. "}
{"text": "A deviation from design trim of up to 1% of L is normally acceptable when using hydrostatic data calculated "}
{"text": "at design trim. Otherwise, the hydrostatic data should be calculated for the actual trim. Caution should be "}
{"text": "exercised when applying this \"1 per cent rule of thumb\" to ensure that excessive error, as would result from a "}
{"text": "significant change in the waterplane area due to heel, is not introduced into the stability calculations. "}
{"text": "The specific gravity of the seawater should be accurately recorded. "}
{"text": "4.3 Tanks "}
{"text": "The anticipated liquid loading for a lightweight survey must be included in the planning for the survey. "}
{"text": "Preferably, tanks should be empty and clean, or completely full. The number of filled-up tanks should be "}
{"text": "reduced as far as practicable. When a lightweight survey has been accepted as replacement for an inclining test "}
{"text": "on newbuildings, the limitations of tank contents as given in 4.5 below apply.  "}
{"text": "Filled-up tanks shall not contain air pockets caused by trim or inappropriate location of ventilation pipes. "}
{"text": "Less than 100% full tanks (for example 98% as often used for loading conditions) are not acceptable. Before "}
{"text": "tanks are sounded, the ship should be heeled to both sides trimmed as necessary to avoid air pockets. "}
{"text": "A list of the planned contents of each tank during the lightweight survey shall be submitted to the surveyor in "}
{"text": "ample time prior to the execution. This list shall also provide the necessary information regarding the "}
{"text": "procedures for verifying the tanks’ contents and their centres of gravity. "}
{"text": "If the total tank contents exceed 20% of the ship's displacement, the specific gravity of these contents must be "}
{"text": "verified by measurement. "}
{"text": "Connections, including manifolds, between tanks containing liquid shall be closed prior to the survey, and "}
{"text": "their controls secured in order to avoid unintended operation. "}
{"text": "Notwithstanding these limitations, it must be assured that the tank contents are sufficient to obtain adequate "}
{"text": "stability during measurements. "}
{"text": "4.4 Draught measurements "}
{"text": "Prior to the survey, the depth of water should be measured and recorded in as many locations as are necessary "}
{"text": "to ensure that the ship will not touch the bottom. "}
{"text": "Draughts and freeboard shall be measured prior to the survey and in the case of an inclining test immediately "}
{"text": "before the weight movements. The measurements should be checked after the survey to verify that there have "}
{"text": "not been any changes in draught and trim during the survey or inclining test. "}
{"text": "Whenever possible, a dinghy should be available for the draught and freeboard measurements. To avoid the "}
{"text": "effects of surge the draught readings may be taken with the help of a transparent plastic tube, throttled in the "}
{"text": "submerged end. "}
{"text": "As a minimum, draughts shall be measured at the fore and aft draught marks in addition to measuring the "}
{"text": "freeboard amidships at both sides. For large ships, or whenever a hogging or sagging condition may be "}
{"text": "expected, additional freeboard readings should be taken approximately halfway between amidships and the fore "}
{"text": "and aft draught marks. "}
{"text": "If correct application of the draught marks has not been previously verified, additional freeboard readings "}
{"text": "should be taken, preferably at the draught marks if the hull shape so permits. "}
{"text": "In case of trim, the longitudinal position of all readings must be verified in order to correct the values relative "}
{"text": "to the reference planes used in the ship's hydrostatic calculations. The longitudinal position of freeboard "}
{"text": "readings must always be carefully verified for ships with sheer. "}
{"text": "If the ship has substantial trim, all vertical readings may need correction with respect to the trim angle in "}
{"text": "order to coincide with the definition of draught for trimmed waterlines in the hydrostatic calculations. "}
{"text": "If freeboards are not measured from the deck corner, the vertical reference point must be checked and noted. "}
{"text": "4.5 Additional requirements for inclining tests "}
{"text": "Movable items "}
{"text": "Excess crew or personnel not directly involved in an inclining test shall not be on board the ship during the "}
{"text": "test. "}
{"text": "All items which may swing or shift must be secured. Cranes, derricks, forklifts etc. shall be stowed and "}
{"text": "secured in their seagoing position. "}
{"text": "Hatch covers etc. not needed open during the test shall be fixed in their seagoing position. "}
{"text": "The number of slack tanks should be kept to an absolute minimum. The viscosity of the fluid, the depth of the "}
{"text": "fluid and the shape of the tank should be such that the free surface effect can be accurately determined. "}
{"text": "Normally, just one or two of the following kinds will be accepted partly filled: "}
{"text": "- freshwater tank "}
{"text": "- fuel oil tank "}
{"text": "- fuel oil service tank "}
{"text": "In order to obtain reliable free surface corrections, slack tanks, if any, should be filled within these limits: "}
{"text": "- Deep tanks: 20-80 per cent full "}
{"text": "- Double bottom tanks: 40-60 per cent full "}
{"text": "Tanks not intended to contain liquid shall be completely empty. "}
{"text": "The number of filled-up tanks shall be reduced to the minimum that is necessary to maintain sufficient "}
{"text": "stability during the test. "}
{"text": "Moorings "}
{"text": "The ship should be moored in a quiet, sheltered area free from extraneous forces such as waves and propeller "}
{"text": "wash from passing vessels or sudden discharges from shore side pumps. The tide conditions and the trim of the "}
{"text": "ship during the test should be taken into account. The ship should be moored in a manner to allow unrestricted "}
{"text": "heeling. The access ramps should be removed. Power lines, hoses, etc., connected to shore should be at a "}
{"text": "minimum, and kept slack at all times. "}
{"text": "The ship should be as upright as possible and have sufficient draught so that any abrupt changes in the "}
{"text": "waterplane will be avoided, as the ship is inclined from side to side. With inclining weights in the initial "}
{"text": "position, up to one-half degree of list is acceptable. "}
{"text": "Inclining weights "}
{"text": "The total weight used should preferably be sufficient to provide a minimum inclination of 2 degrees and a "}
{"text": "maximum of 4 degrees of heel to each side. However, a minimum inclination of 1.5 degrees to each side may "}
{"text": "be accepted for large ships such as tankers and bulk carriers. "}
{"text": "Test weights should be compact and of such a configuration that the VCG (vertical centre of gravity) of the "}
{"text": "weights can be accurately determined. Each weight should be marked with an identification number and its "}
{"text": "mass. If reliable information on the weights cannot be presented to the surveyor, re-certification of the test "}
{"text": "weights should be carried out prior to the test. "}
{"text": "Inclining weights made of porous material which may absorb water must always be weighed prior to the test, "}
{"text": "and their use should only be accepted if the conditions are such that no further absorption may occur. "}
{"text": "A crane of sufficient capacity and reach, or some other means, should be available during the inclining test to "}
{"text": "shift weights on the deck in an expeditious and safe manner. Using the ship's own cranes or derricks is "}
{"text": "normally not acceptable. "}
{"text": "Water ballast is generally not acceptable as inclining weights. However, for large ships, water ballast transfer "}
{"text": "between tanks of a right-sided shape may be permitted, subject to prior consent by the Administration, and only "}
{"text": "when it is absolutely impractical to incline using solid weights. In such cases, accurate sounding tables are of "}
{"text": "vital importance. The specific gravity of the ballast water in such tanks must be accurately recorded, and ballast "}
{"text": "line branches not necessary for the conduct should be blind-flanged. "}
{"text": "Pendulums A minimum of two pendulums should be used to allow identification of bad readings at any one pendulum "}
{"text": "station. They should each be located in an area protected from the wind. "}
{"text": "The pendulums should be long enough to give a measured deflection, to each side of upright, of at least 15 "}
{"text": "cm. To ensure that recordings from individual instruments are kept separate, it is suggested that the pendulums "}
{"text": "be physically located as far apart as practicable. "}
{"text": "The use of an inclinometer or U-tube may be considered in each separate case. Inclinometers or other "}
{"text": "measuring devices may, however, only be used in conjunction with at least one pendulum. "}
{"text": "Efficient two-way communications should be provided between a central control station and the weight "}
{"text": "handlers and between the central control station and each pendulum station. One person at the central control "}
{"text": "station should have complete control over all personnel involved in the test. "}
{"text": "Fig. 1 Recommended set-up of pendulums "}
{"text": "Use of U-tube "}
{"text": "Fig. 2 Reading of U-tube "}
{"text": "Where a U-tube is used as a substitute for a pendulum the following must be complied with: "}
{"text": "- The vertical ends of the device should be securely positioned as far outboard as possible. In any case shall "}
{"text": "the horizontal distance between the ends be sufficient to obtain a level difference of at least 15 cm between "}
{"text": "the upright and the maximum inclination to each side. "}
{"text": "- It must be assured that the vertical ends are long enough to ensure that at maximum inclinations the water "}
{"text": "level will neither overflow nor disappear from the vertical ends. "}
{"text": "- Fixed arrangements must be made for recording all readings at both ends. "}
{"text": "- Clear plastic tube or hose must be used throughout in order to check for air pockets. "}
{"text": "A small amount of ink or dye may be added to the water in the device for improved visibility. "}
{"text": "Inclinometers "}
{"text": "A copy of a calibration certificate from an institution acceptable to the Administration must be delivered to "}
{"text": "the surveyor prior to the test. As an additional confirmation, the inclinations obtained from the device must "}
{"text": "coincide with those from a pendulum. "}
{"text": "The accuracy of the instrument should be in the order of +/- 0.01 degrees. "}
{"text": "4.6 Plans required "}
{"text": "The person in charge of the inclining test should have available a copy of the following plans at the time of "}
{"text": "the inclining test: "}
{"text": "- lines drawing "}
{"text": "- hydrostatic data "}
{"text": "- general arrangement plan of decks, holds, inner bottoms, etc. "}
{"text": "- capacity plan showing capacities and vertical and longitudinal centres of gravity of cargo spaces, tanks, "}
{"text": "etc. "}
{"text": "- sounding tables "}
{"text": "- draught mark locations "}
{"text": "- docking drawing with keel profile and draught mark corrections (if available) "}
{"text": "5. Conducting an inclining test "}
{"text": "5.1 Requirements "}
{"text": "The standard test employs at least eight distinct weight movements where movement no. 8 shall be a recheck "}
{"text": "of the zero point. The tangent to the accumulated pendulum deflection and the accumulated inclining moment "}
{"text": "shall be plotted in a diagram after each movement. The weight movements shall be such as to obtain distinct "}
{"text": "intermediate values between the zero point and the maximum deflections to each side in order to demonstrate "}
{"text": "linearity. "}
{"text": "The inclining test will not be complete until 8 acceptable plotted points have been achieved. If a reasonably "}
{"text": "straight-line plot is not obtained, those weight movements that did not yield acceptable plotted points should be "}
{"text": "repeated or the error source should be identified and corrected. "}
{"text": "Disregarding plots and determining the ship’s metacentric height by calculation alone (such as mean value of "}
{"text": "single values or “the least square method”) is unacceptable, as errors and deviations may become hidden in the "}
{"text": "results. "}
{"text": "Unfavourable weather and sea conditions may lead to an unacceptable degree of accuracy caused by for "}
{"text": "instance difficulties obtaining accurate draught and freeboard measurements, irregular pendulum readings and "}
{"text": "variable external moments. If the ambient conditions are such that there is reason to believe that accurate results "}
{"text": "cannot be obtained, the test shall be postponed if it is not possible to move the ship to a better location. Failure "}
{"text": "to achieve a straight line plot under such conditions should be taken as an indication that satisfactory results "}
{"text": "may not be possible. "}
{"text": "It is required that inclination measurements are taken at least at 2 independent stations. If the plots from these "}
{"text": "stations do not coincide, the reason must be found, corrected and the test repeated or postponed as appropriate. "}
{"text": "If more than 2 stations are used, the results will be acceptable if 2 of those stations coincide. "}
{"text": "A copy of the inclining data should be forwarded to the surveyor along with the calculated results of the "}
{"text": "inclining test in a report format laid down by the Norwegian Maritime Authority. Unless otherwise agreed, the "}
{"text": "NMA standard form “Report on inclining test and calculation of lightship data” (Report 79) shall be used. "}
{"text": "All calculations performed during the inclining test and in preparation of an inclining test report may be "}
{"text": "carried out by a suitable computer program. Output generated by such a program may be used for presentation "}
{"text": "of all or partial data and calculations included in the test report if it is clear, concise, well documented, and "}
{"text": "generally consistent in form and content with the standard form. "}
{"text": "5.2 Interpretation of plotted readings "}
