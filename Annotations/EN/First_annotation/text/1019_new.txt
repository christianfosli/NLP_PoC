Section 8 
Survival craft 
Sufficient number of survival craft has to be carried in order to ensure that in the event of any one survival craft being 
lost or rendered unserviceable, the remaining survival craft can accommodate the total number of persons the ship is 
certified to carry. When calculating the capacity, consideration shall be given to whether failures or faults in common 
components can result in one survival craft being lost or rendered unserviceable. If the ship is fitted with an evacuation 
system in accordance with section 10, the additional survival craft shall be capable of being connected to this system. 
Liferafts shall be capable of being safely moored to the embarkation station. 
Passenger ships engaged on foreign voyages, irrespective of year of construction, shall carry survival craft in 
accordance with the requirements of SOLAS regulation III/21. This shall not, however, apply to passenger ships 
operating in trade area small coasting or lesser, cf. section 7.  
Passenger ships engaged on foreign voyages, irrespective of year of construction, operating in trade area 3 or lesser 
may carry open reversible inflatable liferafts complying with the requirements of the International Code of Safety for 
High-Speed Craft adopted by IMO resolution MSC.97(73) on 5 December 2000 chapter 8.10.2.  
Cargo ships, with the exception of tankers, may in trade area 2 or lesser carry one liferaft capable of being launched 
from either side of the ship. 
Tankers shall either carry one enclosed lifeboat on both sides of the ship or a free-fall lifeboat located at the stern, with 
sufficient capacity to carry at least the total number of persons on board. 
Cargo ships of 8 to 15 metres in overall length engaged on domestic voyages and carrying not more than three persons 
on board, may carry liferafts that are not wheel-marked when each liferaft is: 
a)  intended for at least four persons; 
b)  manufactured in accordance with ISO 9650-1 (Group A); 
c)  placed in accordance with the recommendations from the manufacturer, but not more than six metres above 
the waterline in the least favourable loading condition; 
d)  provided with a float-free arrangement in accordance with section 4.1.6 of the LSA Code (Res.MSC.48(66) 
and MSC.81(70)); 
e)  in compliance with the requirements of the LSA Code for buoyancy of liferafts stowed with a float-free 
arrangement. 
Barges in trade area 3 or greater trade area shall be equipped with at least one inflatable liferaft with sufficient capacity 
to carry everyone on board. Barges in trade areas 1 and 2 shall be equipped with a CE marked motor-powered workboat which at least satisfies the requirements for design category C, or a liferaft that can carry at least the total number of 
persons on board. For barges carrying flammable liquid cargo, the Norwegian Maritime Authority will lay down the 
requirements in each individual case, depending on the barge’s manning, trade area, construction and operational 
conditions. 
Amended by Regulation of 14 October 2016 No. 1211 (in force on 17 October 2016). 
Section 9 
Rescue boats 
Rescue boat means a boat that has been designed to save persons in distress and to assist survival craft.

an arrangement for rescue boat embarkation. 
On cargo ships and passenger ships certified for trade area 3 and lesser trade areas, the rescue boat may be included in 
the survival craft capacity, cf. section 6, section 7 and section 8 sixth paragraph. 
On passenger ships required to carry a rescue boat, the rescue boat shall be fitted with a rescue frame for recovery of 
persons from the sea. 
Ships that are not required to carry a rescue boat shall carry out a risk assessment demonstrating the vessel’s ability to 
handle emergencies. Such ships shall: 
a)  be provided with a device that makes it possible to recover a helpless person from the water;  
b)  be so arranged that it is possible to observe from the bridge at the conning position that a helpless person is 
recovered from the water; 
c)  have manoeuvrability under any conditions to get close to and to easily recover persons from the water; and 
d)  have a lifting appliance which is located in a readily accessible place, ready for immediate use and 
dimensioned for a static load of minimum 200 kg if the freebord is more than 1 metre. 
The Norwegian Maritime Authority may exempt a passenger ship of less than 30 metres in length (L) operating in 
trade area 2 or lesser from the requirement for a rescue boat when the requirements pursuant to the fifth paragraph are 
met. 
Amended by Regulation of 14 October 2016 No. 1211 (in force on 17 October 2016). 
Section 9a 
Rescue ladder and dead man’s switch

Evacuation systems on passenger ships  
engaged on domestic voyages 
Passenger ships engaged on domestic voyages shall, in lieu of meeting the requirements of SOLAS regulation III/16.1, 
be fitted with a marine evacuation system (MES) if the ship does not carry lifeboats or davit-launched liferafts and for 
which the distance in any intact or damaged condition in accordance with approved stability calculations from the 
waterline to the embarkation deck is 1.5 metres or more. In respect of passenger ships for which there is no requirement 
for stability calculations, the distance shall be measured in the lightship condition from the waterline to the embarkation 
deck. 
MES shall be installed on both sides of the passenger ship. The system shall be operational even if the ship has a list 
of up to 10 degrees in either direction. Alternatively, the ship may be provided with at least one embarkation station with 
an associated arrangement on both sides of the ship, having a capacity of at least 100% of the number of passengers.
