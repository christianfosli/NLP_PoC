General provisions 
Section 1   
Scope of application 
The trade areas laid down in these Regulations and the interpretation of the trade areas shall be applied when issuing 
certificates. The interpretation herein shall also be applied for all regulations laid down pursuant to the Act of 16

Definition of trade areas 
For the purpose of these Regulations, “trade area” means the clearly defined waters in which a ship may trade, so as 
to directly influence the construction, equipment, manning and operation of the ship. The trade area includes all waters 
within the outer boundaries set out. Ships, equipment and crew shall be considered as a whole unit, so that the 
certificate which imposes the greatest restriction shall be decisive with regard to the trade area permitted. 
Section 3   
Duties 
The company, master and other persons working on board shall perform their duties in accordance with the Ship 
Safety and Security Act and the supplementary provisions laid down in these Regulations. 
Amended by Regulation of 29 June 2007 No. 1006 (in force on 1 July 2007).

Exemptions 
The Norwegian Maritime Authority may, in individual cases and upon written application, grant exemption from the
