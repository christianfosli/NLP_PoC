{"text": "of 1:40, whichever is greater, and the vertical extent up to at least three superstructure standard heights "}
{"text": "above the bulkhead (freeboard) deck; "}
{"text": "3.2.2. hull thickness of flooded spaces should not exceed 4 mm; "}
{"text": "3.2.3. in both intact and damaged conditions, the model should satisfy the correct displacement and draught "}
{"text": "marks (TA, TM, TF, port and starboard) with a maximum tolerance in any draught mark of + 2 mm. "}
{"text": "Draught marks forward and aft should be located as near FP and AP as practicable; "}
{"text": "3.2.4. all damaged compartments and ro-ro spaces should be modelled with the correct surface and volume "}
{"text": "permeabilities (actual values and distributions) ensuring that floodwater mass and mass distribution "}
{"text": "are correctly represented; "}
{"text": "3.2.5 the characteristics of motion of the actual ship should be modelled properly, paying particular attention "}

{"text": "3.2.6. main design features such as watertight bulkheads, air escapes, etc., above and below the bulkhead "}

{"text": "3.3.  The model in the flooded equilibrium condition should be heeled by an additional angle corresponding to "}

{"text": "4.1.  The model should be tested in a long-crested irregular seaway defined by the JONSWAP spectrum with "}
{"text": "significant wave height HS, a peak enhancement factor Γ =3.3 and a peak period TP= (4√HS(TZ = "}
{"text": "(TP/1.285))). HS is the significant wave height for the area of operation, which is not exceeded by a "}
{"text": "probability of more than 10% on a yearly basis, but limited to a maximum of 4 m. "}
{"text": "Furthermore, "}
{"text": "4.1.1. the basin width should be sufficient to avoid contact or other interaction with the sides of the basin and "}
{"text": "is recommended not to be less than LBP + 2 m; "}
{"text": "4.1.2 the basin depth should be sufficient for proper wave modelling but should not be less than 1 m; 4.1.3. for a representative wave realisation to be used, measurements should be performed prior to the test at "}
{"text": "three different locations within the drift range; "}
{"text": "4.1.4. the wave probe closer to the wave maker should be located at the position where the model is placed "}
{"text": "when the test starts; "}
{"text": "4.1.5. variation in HS and TP should be within ± 5% for the three locations; and "}
{"text": "4.1.6. during the tests, for approval purposes, a tolerance of + 2.5% in HS, ± 2.5% in TP and ± 5% in TZ "}
{"text": "should be allowed with reference to the probe closer to the wave maker. "}
{"text": "4.2.  The model should be free to drift and placed in beam seas (90° heading) with the damage hole facing the "}
{"text": "oncoming waves, with no mooring system permanently attached to the model used. To maintain a beam sea "}
{"text": "heading of approximately 90° during the model test the following requirements should be satisfied: "}
{"text": "4.2.1. heading control lines, intended for minor adjustment, should be located at the centre line of the stem "}
{"text": "and stern, in a symmetrical fashion and at a level between the position of KG and the damaged "}
{"text": "waterline; and "}
{"text": "4.2.2. the carriage speed should be equal to the actual drift speed of the model with speed adjustment made "}
{"text": "when necessary. "}
{"text": "4.3.  At least 10 experiments should be carried out. The test period for each experiment should be of a duration "}
{"text": "such that a stationary state is reached, but not less than 30 min in full-scale. A different wave realisation train "}
{"text": "should be used for each experiment. "}
{"text": "5.  Survival criteria "}
{"text": "The model should be considered as surviving if a stationary state is reached for the successive test runs as "}
{"text": "required in paragraph 4.3. The model should be considered as capsized if angles of roll of more than 30° to "}
{"text": "the vertical axis or steady (average) heel greater than 20° for a period longer than three minutes full-scale "}
{"text": "occur, even if a stationary state is reached. "}
{"text": "6.  Test documentation "}
{"text": "6.1.  The model test programme should be approved by the Administration in advance. "}
{"text": "6.2.  Tests should be documented by means of a report and a video or other visual records containing all relevant "}
{"text": "information on the model and the test results, which are to be approved by the Administration. These should "}
{"text": "include, as a minimum, the theoretical and measured wave spectra and statistics (HS, TP, TZ) of the wave "}
{"text": "elevation at the three different locations in the basin for a representative realisation, and for the tests with the "}
{"text": "model, the time series of main statistics of the measured wave elevation close to the wave maker and records "}
{"text": "of model roll, heave and pitch motions, and of the drift speed. "}
